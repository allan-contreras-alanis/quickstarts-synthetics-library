# Name of your quickstart as shown on the website
name: NRQLCompareWith
description: >
  Execute a NRQL query through NerdGraph to compare results over a period in time. The script will fail if the current result decreases from the previous result more than a given threshold (thresPercent). 
  The query and comparison windows are defined as variables to make adjustments easier.
  The query result logic in the callback function may need adjusted if NRQL functions other than count are used.
